Explanation

**Importing SwiftUI:** We start by importing the SwiftUI framework.

**State Variables:** We create state variables for username and password.

**VStack Layout:** The overall layout is a vertical stack (VStack) that aligns elements vertically.

**Logo Placeholder:** We use the Image view to place a logo (in this case, using a system image as a placeholder).

**TextField and SecureField:** These fields allow users to input their username and password.

**Sign Up Button:** A button that triggers the sign-up action.

**Styling:** Elements are styled and padded to create an appealing layout.

This code will create a simple and visually appealing login screen for an iPhone app. 
Feel free to replace the system image with your actual logo and customize the button action as needed.
